**Search can now time out** if it takes too long

Added ***!random*** command -> Invokes a completely random command in rexbot's arsenal.

**!help** shows only available functions in current mode.
**!help <command>** indicates if it can be used in Xander mode.

Added stopwords to make most frequent word stats more interesting

Can update bot vocab + aliases without restarting bot with **!reload**

**Mode defaults to "quiet (all functions online)"** but automatically switches to Xander mode when Xander comes online.
(mode can still be toggled manually by mode mods)

These users can change mode at any time with "!mode":
