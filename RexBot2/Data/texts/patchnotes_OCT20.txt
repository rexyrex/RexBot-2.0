Huge Update!!

Bot now uses a deep learning model to come up with (hopefully) comprehensible responses to your messages.

There can be significant delays for responses as it tries to come up with accurate answers rather than the first response it can think of.

Model has been trained on reddit forums, youtube comments, and our discord history. 

I used an LSTM (Long short-term memory recurrent neural network) with some convolution.

Bot will go offline from time to time to retrain itself on discord chat data.

Please report any bugs as I haven't been able to test everything thoroughly :)

Additional Updates:

1. Bot will now act differently towards different people depending on the language they use, the functions they call, and their name.

2. !w now boasts a wider variety of annoying tts messages.

3. Bot will occasionally send pm's that are 100% helpful. Please don't respond to pm's unless the bot asks you to do so.

Future updates:

1. Working on fixing the semi-bug where bot will shutdown when geoff or nick activates cat mode.

NOTE: Catmode has been temporarily deactivated
