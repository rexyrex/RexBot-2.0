The reports update.

You cannot save or load !report anymore. (i'm looking at you geoff)

Rexbot can report you internally based on how much it hates you. (your reports can jump from 10 to 30 if it hates you enough)

Rexbot will randomly pm you to annoy you the more reports you have.

Rexbot will start to ignore your requests as you are reported more. (higher reports = higher ignore chance)

Reports will be reset from time to time so you are not doomed forever.

Some EXTREMELY annoying tts phrases added to !w. (Very low chance of activation but it lasts over a minute)
